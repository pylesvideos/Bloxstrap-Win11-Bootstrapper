# Bloxstrap Windows 11 Bootstrapper Theme
A bootstrapper theme that looks like the Windows 11 Boot screen.
Just download the theme folder and import it into the custom theme settings

the icon is optional, it's meant to be a custom icon (you can change it in the settings)

also this has only been tested on voidstrap 🤫
